This race was the first proper XC race of the season for me. After missing the first race in Lethbridge and a terrible race at the Alex Steida Crit, a part of me was dreading the race, but at the same time I was excited to be racing again. This would hopefully be the first race that I could not only finish the race, but RACE. After a chill week just winding down from the Criterium and nursing my back I was as ready as I could be. My back was feeling a bit better, unsure of my legs.

Since I had work Friday evening I'd be heading to the race Saturday morning, with no time to pre ride, I was going in blind. I rolled into Canmores Nordic Centre 1.5hrs before the race. Walking around seeing faces I haven't seen in an year, everyone primed with their new race machines, I could feel myself getting nervous. 1hr before the race I baggied up and got on my bike. My legs felt like crap or maybe it was just the nerves messing with my mind.

Now that I think of it I don't know what I was nervous about. I had nothing to lose, I had virtually no chance at Canada Summer Games, Nationals was in Canmore, there was no other provincial projects I'd be eligible for. I was also racing in elite so there was no possibility of having a top result either.

Off the line I got a few decent pedal strokes in and than I was swallowed by the pack. I rode mid pack for the first lap, second lap, I could feel my back getting tighter and tighter. I was getting worried, I didn't want it to completely seize up on me like a few weeks ago. Also at that point in the race I was battling against a Deadgoat rider. I would be just barely holding on to him on the climbs and then creating a bit of a gap on the descents.

As I left the start/finish area on the last lap I was with 2 other Deadgoat riders, as we headed into the single track climb I made sure to get in between the two so they'd have at least a harder time playing team tactics. I was struggling to hold the riders wheel, really having to go into the red to keep in touch. It was a huge relief once we got to the top where it plateaued on some double track, making sure the rider behind me doesn't attack. Afterwards back into the single track with a bunch of short punchy climbs.

It was nerve racking following his wheel making sure I don't screw up while still pushing the pace, once we neared the top of the climb the trail flattened out a little where I knew I had to make my move. As soon as there was an opening I jumped through the opening and passed the Deadgoat rider. From there on was all up to me. Making sure to keep the pace high on the descents to keep the other riders off my wheel at the same time I take calculated risks to not crash. About half way down the decent I caught the rider in front of me. I was worried, at that pace the riders behind me would catch up as well. But fortunately for me he pulled over and let me by. Since we were both in the same category he didn't have to do that, but I wasn't complaining. As I got to the final long stretch to the line I saw Sean in front of me, I gave it a mad sprint to the line to catch up to him but he was too far away.

Right as I crossed the line and sat up I could feel that my back was in horrible shape. It was still as a plank of wood and it was only getting tighter. After spinning around for a little I was able to keep it from completely seizing up on me. Overall I ended up in 10th place out of 20 riders, although still over 8min behind the leader I was happy given the circumstances.
