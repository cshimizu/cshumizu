Finally after a long cold winter I had the chance to get out of cold Edmonton and ride some dirt in 
Victoria, It was great to be back again, riding in the warm, humid, West coast. Fortunately the first 
day we were there, the weather was nice enough to give us some sunshine, it was nice to be back on the 
bike without having to wear 5 layers to protect me from the elements. The first ride at Hartland, I had 
forgotten how technical the Island was, and that combined with riding on dirt for the first time in months
 made my technical feeling very sloppy. There was a lot more walking than I had hoped for. By the second 
 day I was feeling a lot better, and my technical skills were coming back, my new XTR 11 speed drive train 
 worked flawlessly in the wet, and mud of Victoria. At this camp we also had the opportunity to ride the 
 Canada Cup course at Bear Mountain. It was nice to be able to have a general idea of the course which I 
 would be racing on in around 3 weeks. The course was a good mix of slow technical trails as well as fast,
 flow, fun trails. Although there was a little more pavement/double track than Id like. The next few days 
 we spent time at the Hartland bike park, sessioning a few technical sections where we refined our line 
 choices, and body positions. This was nice to be able to work on the basics and refine my riding to gain
 more “Free Speed”. By the end we went to a feature called “Megarock” on the trail called Who`s Your Daddy 
 the drop was a good arm length higher than my head.

On the second last day it had been raining all night and all day, the trails that we have been riding days
 earlier became practically rivers, there were pools of water that were up to the hub of my bike. Although 
 it was a wet cold ride, it was still one of the best rides of the trip, as we tried to find the trail 
 called Legends, we ended up going to the edge of Hartland and doing loops which lead to a small river. 
 On the very last day we had the chance to ride with Jordie Lunn and we got to work on our jumping at the 
 Bear Mountain Bike Park.

It was an awesome time to get away from Edmonton and ride some dirt for a while, and to be able to ride 
the Canada Cup Course before the race in a few weeks.
