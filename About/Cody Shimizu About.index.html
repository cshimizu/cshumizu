About me, so as you know my name is Cody Shimizu I am 18 years old and this is my site
that I decided to try and make while I wait for my ankle that I broke to fix up, although
I used to have a blog made by one of those cheap online web creator things, since Im waaay 
too cheap to actually pay for one of those things, and I couldent design a side to my liking
on their "free version" so I decided to try my hand at actually using html and stuff to 
make a website.

Anyways, about me; I currently live in Edmonton, AB and my main interest is cycling as you`d 
figured from all of the photos so far. Although cycling pretty much consumes all of my life I 
also like photography as well with my 10 years old Nikon D60. I am currently taking a year off
from schooling as I had just graduated from high school and pretty much supposed to be riding 
my bike and working but unfortunately not that I had broken my ankle I am sitting at home with
nothing better to do than make a website.
