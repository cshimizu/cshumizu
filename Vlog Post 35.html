<p class="blogtext">
The word that has tainted the cycling world for close to 20 years now, the poorly kept secret of biological warfare between skinny armed, clean shaven, lycra wearing herd of people started being unravelling to the rest of the world starting with the Festina affair in the 1998 Tour de France. The pandora’s box was open, the truth being gossiped in households, the next generation of cyclists would have to struggle to regain and rebuild the trust that people would put on anyone under the banner of a “cyclist”.  In the 80’s you look at any sport, from running, cycling, baseball, weightlifting they all had one thing in common, doping. Since then many sports have cracked down on dopers, refusing to look away whether it be for the true passion of the sport, or just a PR stunt it worked; to the world they demonstrated the rise and fall of superstars, the consequences of doping. Ben Johnson, Floyd Landis, Ross Rebagliati, Tyson Gay just to name a few doping became a thing of the past. Unfortunately cycling, and doping were like star crossed lovers, nothing could separate them, every few years we would catch news about a big name in cycling caught doping. You Google “doping in sports” and guarantee every single article will mention cycling (maybe with the exception of the Russia scandal, WHICH was also uncovered by a documentary initially made for doping in cycling). The world of cycling’s refusal to deal with dopers right in front of our eyes, where we even suspect our own heroes of doping is the world that has been shaped through neglect, denial, and refusal to actually take action, people who are caught doping still linger in and around the sport like a suspicious window covered van waving over desperate young cyclists, putting them in the never-ending cycle of doping. Although its starting to change with institutions such as WADA (World anti-doping agency), Raceclean, UCI starting to make change, it’s a slow change, not quick enough.

Doping, but why? Why; the three words that can make people question everything kick them off the tracks, lose their minds, or it can bring sense and understanding in their beliefs and actions. Maybe to people like me, that has never gone near EPO, testosterone injections, steroids for the purpose of “performance enhancement” may never understand. Rather it makes me question, this sport that I am so passionate for that I assume these people who make a living out of it. Why, why would they ever destroy the image of the thing they love just to cross a line, but they don’t realize they crossed the wrong line one to be never crossed, to be doping. Is this what cycling has become, it doesn’t matter how as long as you cross the line first? The pay cheque, the glory is worth more than the integrity of the word that connects our community, a cyclist. A part of me thinks I understand, I dreamed a dream of one day racing 2 wheels for a living. Looking at photos, videos, of professional riders in amazing places doing what they love for a living. Who wouldn’t want to do that. But with little guidance, and a training plan that I cobbled together from Facebook articles and GCN videos (GCN is a cycling YouTube channel), I wasn’t going anywhere quickly. I was running myself into the ground trying to do so many intervals in a week not accounting for recovery and rest, no real long-term plan I was burning myself out. This thought of thinking that I was doing everything I should be (looking back I should’ve been smarter) but I was thinking with my passion rather than my head. I had reached a point of desperation, a deep part of my mind of why’s and what if’s. What if I doped. The moment it flashed into my mind I was scared, what had I done to come to this point of desperation to even consider doping. Looking back maybe it was the moment I told myself that some dreams are meant to stay as dreams. So, I ask again, why dope? Out of desperation? For your ego? Just to prove to others that you’re better than them? I’ll never know; never.

What is doping? Although some dreams are meant to be dreams, the passion is real. Cycling will always be a part of my life, and hopefully one day for me a career. Studying kinesiology I have the opportunity to learn about how doping works down to every molecule involved in hopes that one day it will be the thing of the past. To eliminate something first you need to understand what you’re up against. In the past, the early days of Lance Armstrong, blood doping was common. All you do is inject your own blood right before a race, with an increase in blood volume, this allows your body to transport, consume, and utilize oxygen at a much quicker rate. More recently the word EPO is being thrown around in the world of cycling, in short it is the seed of red blood cells. EPO is called erythropoietin, a hormone to tell your body to tell you to make more blood. EPO is naturally created in the human body since it is a hormone, so let’s take a step back and ask again, what is doping? Consider the case of Caster Semenya, she is an South African middle-distance runner with many world championship, and Olympic titles to her name. She suffers from a case of Hyperandrogenism. This causes her to have unusually high levels of testosterone, close to the level of males. This is because they in reality carry the XY gene in their bodies which is why their bodies produce so much testosterone, and typically the high levels of testosterone will cause their embryos to grow into males with male reproductive organs, but athletes such as Caster Semenya suffer from CAIS (Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome) where their bodies cannot react to the increased levels of testosterone. This insensitivity to testosterone causes their embryo’s to grow into females, with female reproductive organs. The IOC has a rule where people with Hyperandrogenism is forced to take hormone suppressants or even a surgery to reduce the testosterone level in their bodies. But Why? Why do these females need to alter their natural bodies to fit this definition of an female athlete just to compete when there is still no conclusive evidence that Hyperandrogenism gives them an advantage? Take another step back and think, even if it did do they really need to go through hormone therapy or surgery just to compete? We never told Usain Bolt that his legs were genetically too long so he needs to shorten them, or Michel Phelps to make his foot smaller cause they were giving him an flipper like advantage?   </p>

So it begs the question again, what really is doping? Is taking protein doping? Artificially increase the protein levels to help us recover quicker? Where do we draw the line? How about TUE’s (Therapeutic Use Exemptions)? I’ve been to a doctor before because I had a slightly hard time breathing on the bike for a bit. And it didn’t take much before he was offering me corticosteroids because he thought it improved my FEV1 (Test for max volume of air exhaled over 1 seconds) “slightly” I was quick to refuse since it didn’t seem right, taking drugs I didn’t really need. The issue right now with Chris Froome testing for unusually high levels of salbutamol, a drug used for treating asthma. Was he actually “doping”? How much of a difference does an asthma inhaler actually make for people that don’t suffer from asthma, in truth probably not much if any. Or maybe it’s just Chris Froome’s genetics, physiologically just doesn’t breakdown salbutamol very quickly. Would you call doping something that some people have access to while others don’t, creating an “unfair advantage” across the field? Then how about people who can afford all the training facilities one could dream of, compared to maybe someone who doesn’t have a physiotherapist, a team doctor, sports psychologist, or even a coach? Or someone who has the latest and greatest, lightest, most efficient parts for the equipment while others using equipment from 20 years ago? Is that an unfair advantage? Is that... doping?

Doping, its easy we just need to stop it right? Stop what? What is doping? How? What needs to change? Doping in my opinion is a deep-rooted problem starting with the sociological issues surrounding the sport of cycling and doping culture, now with the thought of motor doping it seems like a problem that will never go away. Like a virus, always finding a new way, mutating to work around the detection of the newest drug, or motor to cheat their way to the front. Maybe it starts with education, of knowing what we are dealing with. Cause no matter how big the consequences, thefts still occur, murders still happen, and cyclists are still doping. So next time you’re sitting at a café think, why, and what is doping, and most importantly what can you do to change and restore the integrity of the cyclist.
