This was my second ever fatbike ride let alone race, and the 20cm of snow from the day before worried me it
 was going to be a hard race through the snow. Looking at the weather forecast it looked like it was going 
 to be a cold day. I left my house on the Surley Ice Cream Truck which I borrowed from Revolution Cycle, 
 wearing all of my cycling clothes trying to keep warm, but by the time I got to the Alfred Savage Center
 I was starting to sweat. After I took a few layers off I got to the start line. This time since they cut
 out the prologue loop they decided to do a Le Man start everyone started out running once around the 
 Alfred Savage Center. Since my last race I had a bad start and I looked ridiculous in the video I 
 decided to line up mid pack. Running around the Alfred Savage Center I got behind Ben RIx from 
 Revolution Cycle. On the double track only the middle of the track 5inches wide was packed down which
 made it feel like I was riding skinnies the whole race. Once we got to the single track behind the horse 
 stables, it was even less packed down so it was harder to stay balanced on the trail and find grip on the
 uphills. After we got out of the single track they had us climb up to Saskatchewan Drive on the paved 
 trails which were fortunately cleared, than a sweet downhill single track down to the paved trail by the
 horse stables than back to the Alfred Savage Center. The course it self was just under 10km per lap. For 
 the first lap I just steadly moved my self up through the pack, where I could pass which was only on the
 paved trails so it took me a whole lap to move to the top guys. For lap 2 I mostly rode with Mark Jung 
 and Trevor Pombert. At first I signed up for the 2 lap category, but since the course was a lot shorter
 than expected I decided to upgrade to 3 laps, and for the third lap I just kept riding with Mark and 
 Trevor. By the end of the third lap I my legs were completely burnt, as I checked in for the last time.
 Later I found out that I had won the three lap category!
