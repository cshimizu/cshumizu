2012 was a big year for me, it just started out with riding my bike to school. Ive always been jealous of the kids who rode their bikes to school when I was in elementary; I'd look out the window of the school bus and see them casually pedalling their way into the school while I was being bounced around in a big yellow box. I was happy when I started going to a junior high close to home cause that meant that Id be riding my bike to school. I enjoyed it, up to that point I hadnt really ridden my bike since my neighbours moved away a few years earlier and it was nice to be back on a bike again. I still remember the creeky old walmart bike riding along the river valley. It was only a matter of time until I noticed a little trail running along the path, and one day I saw a cyclist ripping through the trail. That was all it took. I started going down this rabbit hole of a weird sport called cycling.

Next thing I know Im buying an entry level mountain bike (Trek Marin 29). Im discovering a new side of Edmonton, endless trails snaking through the river valley. I was actually starting to like Edmonton. I started meeting people on group rides, discovering new trails, learning to love riding. I loved it, it was like a big secret of Edmonton no one was telling me about. I was meeting new people, learning new skills, and getting fit without even really realizing it.

After constantly showing up for all of the group rides with Redbike it was only a matter of time until Mark Jung would be introducing me to racing, going to the first Fat Tire Tuesday was absolutely nerve wracking, lots of people with expensive bikes and tight spandex looking fit and ready to race, while I stood there with my cargo shorts and loose fitting jearsy. But after the race I was completely hooked! I loved it, going toe to toe with people ripping through single track, legs burning on the climbs I couldnt wait till I did it again. From then on Tuesday nights were the highlights of the week. Having my parents drive me out to Sunridge or Terwilliger every week, it was amazing.

And the rest is history, the sport of cycling slowly took over my life, from going on rides once a week, to 3 days, 5 days a week. Next thing I know bikes were what all I could think about. What tires should I buy? What are the trail conditions like? Where should I ride next? What feature should I try?

Looking back even I dont even know how I got into this sport, talking to most people their parents used to ride bikes so they put their kids on bikes, then onto the trails and that was where they discovered the sport. But for me if I hadnt gone to the junior high I went to, if I never did the MS bike tour in 2012, if my art teacher who was also into mountain biking never was there to tell me about groups rides, would I have never found the sport? What would my life be like? Would I be on drugs? Getting drunk every weekend? Driving a ricer? All I know is that it definitly couldnt have been better then my life right now!
