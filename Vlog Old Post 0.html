Alright, so what the video doesnt show you is the crash. Straight up the hardest hit Ive taken on my bike. Riding along the highway there was a good size chunk of concrete on the side of the highway, and I wasnt paying enough
attention and hit the concrete dead on. I flew off my bike landed head first onto the ground, grinding my front teeth on the ground during the process. Right after I didnt know what even happend. All I know is that Im in a 
shit load of pain. At I try and pull myself together. A random driver, and coach Tracy rush over and tell me to stay down on my back. Next thing I realized that the bottom half of my front tooth are gone. I honestly think
thats all I talked about for the next few minuits, as Tracy was trying to make sure my head was still in one piece. Fortunately for me, I dont know how, but I managed to get out of the ordeal with only some road rash. I 
couldnt believe it! No concussion!
