Well, we are back at this point of the season again where all of the training you did during the cold 
winter month is supposedly going to pay off, since joining Juventus and with the help of their training
 programs, I was feeling pretty confident coming in to this race, but my nerves were getting to me since
 this was a qualification race for both team Alberta for MTB Nationals and Western Canada Summer Games.
 These qualification races always got the best of me. The bad thoughts of getting a flat, mechanical, 
 crashing hard, etc, wouldn’t leave my head but eventually race time was bound to come.
<br><br>
In the days leading up to the race looking at the weather was not looking the greatest, but on the day 
it was great. The course was great, super fast, fun, with lots of flow, there are two steady, leg burning
 climbs in the middle, and the top section was a long flat, mostly double track.
<br><br>
The start of the race was super fast with Michel taking the whole shot and I was right behind him, but in
 the super long start before the first single track another guy passed me and going into the descent I was
 sitting third wheel,  by the time we got to the first climb, I tried making my move but a few guys got in
 front, after a lap there were three definite leaders out front then me with Marcus from Synergy, after a
 few laps his front tire burped which gave me a chance to get away on the down hills, I absolutely loved 
 the down hills.
<br><br>
I ended up 4th which I was really happy about. Cant wait until the next race!
