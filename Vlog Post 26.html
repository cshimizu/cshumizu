This was my first nationals in two years, and I was quite excited. Partly because I knew I was in no shape to even actually contest, let alone finish the race. The race being in Canmore was awsome, after racing there for the past however many years, and hearing about the national championships that happened there before my time I was really looking forward to it. Getting there and riding the course for the first time only made me even more excited. It was hands down the best course Ive ever ridden! The amount of time that the Canmore crew put into completely revolutionizing the Canmore Nordic Centre trails. Racing in Canmore used to be incredible trails connected by the big gravel double track grinds, but the new connector trails that they built keeps things interesting while giving me enough space to get passed by others without blocking them.

The course included all three major features at the Nordic Centre, the Eye Dropper, Get Down, and Organ Donor, and fortunately, or unfortunately, build beautiful new B-Lines for the Eye Dropper, and the Organ Donor, so the advantage of taking the A lines were much less. I was already quite confortable with the Eye Dropper so it was buisness as usual for me there, and during preride Get Down was also fine although the trail was a little bit looser and rutted out nothing seemed too majorly different from the past years Ive ridden there. The Organ Donor, as many times as Ive ridden it, I was still on my nerve, coming around the tight left hander onto the rock as you prepare yourself for the loose rocky descent down, but during a race is much more different than pre ride, youre tired, barely surviving, HR is through the roof, and you dont have a chance to take a look at the feature before you hit it. Funny thing is during the race, the one time I was off the saddle, rear tire buzzing my rear, causing a gasp in the crowd was the Eye Dropper, during pre ride I always told myself “speed killz”. Middle of the race I just passed a Manitoba rider right before the Eye Dropper, eager to distance myself I went in faster than what I was confortable with, my pedal unclips and I just make it down with one foot in the pedal. The next was Get Down.

After all of the crashes in the earlier races, there was a huge crowd of people eager to watch the pros rip down it, and than there was me every lap Id come into it super cautiously. A massive rut had formed and not knowing any better I took it every lap, I might not have been the fastest down it but I sure made it down rubber side down. The Organ Donor was the one that had me on edge, my ideal line was a tight one, where Id have to knit my way through the rock garden, as I got tired lap after lap, I got sloppy just going through the worst lines possible, but that was when I really realized, how “easy” (knock on wood) the Organ Donor was, it really was a combination of two features and the inevitable speed that got on my nerves, but I just had to trust myself and commit, and muscle memory would take care of the rest, but just remember, speed killz. Sometimes it not worth to risk it for the biscuit.

 The race itself was awesome, knowing my fitness and the caliber of the other riders I expected that I would be able to do 3 or 4 laps on a good day, as I was telling myself this people were telling me quit thinking negatively, which for me was hard to understand, I thought I was setting realistic goals for myself. Knowing my shitty year so far, the last thing I needed was to be emotionally crushed just because I was setting absolutely unrealistic goals for myself. Ive been there, let me tell you it doesnt feel good. At all.    </p>

  In the end I was happy to finish 4 laps, and looking at the times, I was only off of getting a 5th lap in by around 2min. Although my results are nothing to be proud of, I felt good, and rode safely and smart, and its really motivated me and look forward to this race next year back in Canmore! Thanks to Sam Poon for the photos.
