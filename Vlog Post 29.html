   It was a hazy day in Calgary`s Shangappi Park. The stage for the first cross race of the Alberta Provincial Cyclocross Series. Pulling my tubular wheelset out for this race I was quite literally dusting them off, as a spider had decided to nest itself in-between the spokes. Inflating the tires, with my fingers crossed in hopes that it actually still holds air, I quickly checked to make sure the tire wasn’t going to peel off the rim and threw them on my bike. Getting to the race, I went through my pre race routine for cross. Pinning the numbers, triple checking the tire pressure, warming up to the cringe noise of your tubulars wearing down on the concrete.

    I made sure to get to the start line early knowing that I wouldn’t have a call up. I was in second row right behind the one and only Sean(Juventus). With nerves running through the field, everybody was itching to start. The whistle goes off, the immediate uphill caused chaos. Wheels crossing, gears crunching, you could quite literally smell burning rubber from everybody touching wheels. I managed to sneak through to be sitting around 5th wheel out of the first corner. Going through the next few sections it was evident I was way out of my league with the people around me. Every pedal stroke I was losing ground. Nearly ¾ around the first lap I was chirping Shawn (Deadgoat) for looking back all the time, in that same moment my front wheel washed out going around a hairpin, it was embarrassing to say the least. Throughout the next few laps I could feel myself fading, legs were burning, lungs lacking oxygen, the heat burning, making stupid mistakes. The only thing that was keeping me in the race was the flyover which I could air out, and a photographer who was there taking photos. But coming around onto the final stretch I saw 3 laps to go. That got my head back in the game, I was lingering behind a big group of 6 or 7 riders. I told myself “3 laps, that’s all you need to salvage this race.”.  I made my way back up to the group within a lap, by the time I got in it was already starting to break up, with Mark (Redbike) and Paul (Hardcore) pushing the pace. I managed to make my way up within the next lap. The last lap was a drag race between Paul and I, managed to pass him over the barriers and made a bit of a gap through the tight turns, but he was right back on my wheel over the straights, and risers, he had the lead going into the last few turns. Going into the last corner we were both flying, a flat, dusty, hairpin. He beat me in the sprint. I ended up in 11th place, which apparently was a good thing as I later found out since this was the 11th year running Beans n Barley they were giving out a prize for the 11th place person!

    The course was full of turns which were deceivingly slippery, and good flow throughout, the flyover is always a nice bonus as well. It was an awesome race to open up the 2017 cross season. I will definitely be looking forward to this race next year.

    Less than 24 hours later I was lining up on the start line for Pumphouse Cross. A part of me was dreading this race a little after last year with lots of straights, heavy grass, and generally a lot of suffering. This was a stark contrast from 2 years ago when Pumphouse cross was actually held IN Pumphouse park, venue was great, and the course was even better with only 1 real straight, otherwise we were pretty much on our side knobs the entire time. This year preriding the course felt great, there was flow through the turns, 3 features to get you off your bike, barriers high enough to make you think you were jumping hurdles.

    I was surprised to find myself getting a call up for the last place on the grid. The comsmisare called “within the next minute” There wasn’t much time for any nerves or tension, as he blew the whistle moments later. Off the start I managed to get out clean and clip in right away. I managed to be third wheel through the first quarter of the lap, sitting behind Sean (Juventus) and Mark (Hotsauce) although it was quite evident that I didn’t have the legs to stay with them, I made to keep my pace so I wouldn’t blow up like yesterday. I managed to prevent a spectacular explosion like yesterday but I still had to REALLY lay off the gas for a few laps to ensure that I could last the entire race. Looking up at the lap counter 4 laps left to go I started ramping it up again, trying to close the gap to the trio in front of me of Ryan (Juventus) Andrew (Lead Out Project) and Paul (Cyclemisters). Paul started dangling off the back to the two up front so I made it my goal to try and catch him, but throughout the last few laps, I managed to close the gap a little bit, but it wasn’t quite enough for me to reach him.

    Im not too sure where I ended up, but this weekend was really a weekend of averages, where I managed to yet again snag a “mid pack/draw prize” at the race. Well, I guess its reassuring to know that your not quite below, nor above average. Apparently I’m one of the most average open cyclocross racers in Alberta LOL.
