End Of The Year Conclusion

So once again its been almost 365 days and a new year is upon us. 2017
 is only a day away, and it is time to look back and see what went wrong,
 and what went right. Unfortunately for me this year had lots more things
 go wrong than right. It all started in January, during a winter ride I
 found out about some black ice by slamming my head again the ground; I 
 got away with some bruises and a broken helmet.

A few weeks later in February I wiped out on some ice again, this time using my knee 
to break the fall, this resulted in a cut large enough to require 5 stiches. Funny thing is 
after the ride I didnt feel the cut on my knee and since it was under my knee warmers I ended
 up chilling in a café for a few hours before I got home and discovered the gash on my knee. 
 This slowed down my riding for a few weeks but I was back on my bike within a few weeks.

The next incident came not surprisingly in March, it was in Penticton with Juventus with the 
junior road camp we have every year. A stupid little incident where riding with the group I 
failed to notice a big chunk of asphalt laying on the shoulder of the road, and before I knew
 what happened I was lying on the ground with my bike on the road. First thing I thought was
 “How did I get sand in my mouth!?” as I spit out little crumbs out from my mouth, only to
 moments later realize that it was pieces from my teeth. Luckily it was my helmet and teeth
 that took most of the impact so I didnt have any visible cuts or bruises just some road rash
 on my shoulder and back. At the hospital in Penticton I was surprised to hear that I didnt 
 have any symptoms of a concussion. So after buying a cheap helmet I rode on for the rest of
 the camp. Back in Edmonton my parents werent too happy to receive the bill from the dentist,
 well at least theres insurance.

May is when the mountain bike season begins in Alberta, and the first race was all the way down 
in Lethbridge, a solid 6 hour drive from Edmonton; one way. I was really nervous about this race 
to see where I am compared to the others, hoping to move up from the expert category. It was also
 a qualifier race for the provincial team going out to nationals. After a short warm up in the 
 heat I nervously waited on the start line, as the gun goes of I got off the line first but it 
 was a long stretch before we got to the single track so I eased off and let a few people go by,
 as we neared I tried moving up the group, and coming up to the first corner with another competitor 
 neither of us wanted to give even a cm to each other as we go into the corner side by side our 
 handle bars got caught and both went down. When I landed I stuck out my arm; big mistake. I ended
 up hyper extending my arm and my race was over. Drove 6 hours to race for 2 min and a DNF.

Later that month was the 2nd qualifier race for the provincial team down in Canmore. I was looking
 forward to the race with my arm feeling better and a course that suits me, but with my luck so 
 far I should have seen it coming. On the second last lap I got a rear flat, after I fixed the tire 
 I was pretty much in last place.

After missing out on nationals I was looking forward to Whistler Canada Cup at Crankworx, 
it was exciting being able to finally ride on the west coast. The night before the race I could 
feel a cold coming, and it hit me the hardest the day of the race, ended up with another DNF 
after the first lap.

All that was left was cross season to look forward to, I was looking forward to cross
 nationals at the new venue in Quebec. The first half of the season went well for me as 
 I was able to build my form through the first few races, but right before the one and 
 only dark night I broke my ankle.

This year was full of firsts, first time getting stiches, breaking 3 helmets, having my arm 
in a sling, breaking a bone, getting surgery. Hopefully next year will be full of first places 
instead.
