    Ghost of Gravel 2018

Ive been really looking forward to this event since the beginning of the year. Gravel racing’s been the hot topic the last few years and I haven’t been able to race in the past few editions of the race since there was always a mountain bike race on the same weekend. Fortunately, this year my calendar was clear and I was looking forward to this race since the Alberta Bicycle Association calendar came out. But as much as I was looking forward to this event I didn’t really train for it which was a big mistake. The longest ride Ive done the past few weeks have all been less than 2 hrs long. Especially with wrapping up spring courses for university.

Fortunately Mike Sarnecki from Kokanee Redbike invited me to go out to the race with him and Stephen (Kokanee Redbike). We drove out on Saturday evening to Olds since the race started really early on Sunday morning. After an eventful night in Olds with half the town having a power outage and a bunch of rednecks running around yelling we got up bright and early at 6Am to drive over to Watervalley. We rolled into Watervalley by 7:30Am when sign on started, it was a cool western style little town, which consisted of around 4 buildings.

As time rolled around to start the race I spotted Phil Gaimon in his beautiful cookie skin suit. Still star struck the race started. As we rolled out as a massive group we meandered through the road we screamed down a descent and as the pavement turned into gravel the pace car turned off and my HR went from 100 to 200bpm within moments. After my body got over the shock of the initial pace I managed to catch on the back of the lead group, lungs on fire, heart firing on all 4 cylinders I struggled, but managed.

As the road turned horizontal, I was really hoping the pace would drop. But it never happened. Whoever was in front (I think it was Phil Gaimon) kept pushing the pace and at this point I was just digging myself a deeper and deeper hole. Only few minutes into the race since the neutral pace car pulled off, following a string of riders desperately trying to hang onto their draft, I managed to find my wheels in a massive pothole, holding onto my bars for dear life I managed to stay up right but I heard a massive pop. Taking a quick glance back I realized it was Mike (Kokanee Redbike). It was on the next climb that I got dropped like a kid chucking rocks into a lake. Looking back there was a massive chase group already forming behind me. As they swallowed me up I sat in the back trying to recover from the insane initial effort.

The next 2 hours was just trying to stay in the chase group, as we slowly made our way over the rolling hills I could slowly feel my legs cramping up on me. Chugging all the water I had with me worried about not wanting to stop at any of the feed stations to stay with the group I drank cautiously. It was too late too little. On the next climb the group slowly crawled away from my reach. Someone who didn’t know anything about cycling would say “they’re right there, just pedal a bit harder! Literally right in front of you!” But they just don’t know. I was gutted, and my myosin and actin not cooperating with me. I can guarantee that watts were not being produced. The rest of the race was about survival, just making it to the finish.

As people were passing me left and right I would try to sit in their wheel but it would end with me just getting dropped again. Making it up to the last feed station still over 30km to the finish I stopped to restock my bottles and get some food, Mike (Kokanee redbike) was there cheering everyone on and getting some footage. After making it look like I was fine on the outside (gotta look good for the camera). I started spending more time looking and counting the km’s on my Garmin, but thankfully the last little 20km or so was on some ultra-smooth gravel, and I just invisible TT bar all the way back (Just resting my elbows on the top of the bar). As I got closer to the finish it was still on the back of my mind what the guy at feed station 3 told me. When I was talking about how steep the climb was up to feed zone 3 he said only one insanely steep, terrible climb to go. As I got closer I saw the pavement and I could only think how close I was to the finish until I realized that the last crazy steep climb was on the pavement. It was long, and awful to kick my ass less then 5km from the line.

I did it, it wasn’t pretty but I finished. The entire event was awesome! Well organized, amazing course, awesome riding. This will definitely on the list of events to go to events for next year and hopefully I’ll be better prepared.
