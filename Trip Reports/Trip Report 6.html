    Since I had a weekend to myself decided to go for a bit of an solo adventure. Unfortunately the weather forecast for the afternoon wasn’t looking too great so had to find a short objective to do in the morning. In all honesty Mt. Burstall wasn’t really on my radar of to do scrambles but after flipping through the Scrambles in the Canadian Rockies book by Alan Kane (Amazing resource by the way) the night before looking for cool shit it definitely caught my eye. Also the 3 km approach along the Burstall  Pass trail is doable on a mountain bike, which I happened to bring along with me.

    I got to the Burstall Pass Trail head not too early in the morning and got my bag packed and my bike assembled. Having the bike was really nice to cut down the time on the approach. It’s a bit of a boring trail with tall tress surrounding you there isn’t much for views either. To find the trail that goes up Mt Burstall follow the Burstall Pass trail for close to 3km, once you pass a large boulder (don’t worry you wont miss it) keep a sharp eye to the left where you’ll see an overgrown trail.

 <div><p class=blogpictext>Following along the ridge was a lot of fun. lots of good scrambling to be had.  </p></div>

    From there I ditched my bike in the bushes and made my way along the overgrown trail. It takes you up through a valley with beautiful flowers that were coming in, once you see the ridge to gain aim for the strip of black scree. It’s a bit loose but not too terrible to make your way up.

    From there route finding was surprisingly simple with the very little visibility I had with some thick clouds rolling through. You pretty much follow the ridgeline along the easiest terrain. You initially stay on climbers left of the ridge, then near the top you will eventually pop out to the climbers right of the mountain to the base of the famous “crack”. From there it’s a pretty quick trot to the summit. Just as an FYI there was a set of bolts at the top of the “crack” section but a bit unnecessary in my opinion.

    Unfortunately with all the clouds rolling through I couldn’t quite get all the views. With the pending weather rolling in for the afternoon I didn’t stay long on the summit. This was one of the best time  : scrambling ratio scrambles I’ve ever done! It was an awesome short adventure definitely worth it for a short day.
