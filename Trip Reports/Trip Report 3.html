This was my first couloir, a classic line visible from the road. Driving by I’ve always wondered how is it possible for anyone to ski that, it was a pretty unreal feeling sitting at the top of the run. The area itself is absolutely beautiful with the views of Dolomite peak, Noseeum Mountain, and Mt. Andromache. Surprisingly a short tour considering how relatively serious of a line it is. This line shouldn’t be taken lightly with the typical hazards of a couloir and alpine touring.

I was already staying at HI Mosquito Creek Hostel so when Bryan and I got up in the morning we didn’t even need to drive anywhere. But if you’re driving you are free to park in the hostel parking lot. It was a bit cloudy out in the morning but with good enough visibility to assess overhead hazard we decided to make our way up to see if we can find a reason to turn around.

The avalanche forecast for the day wasn’t looking too favourable but wind slabs were their main concern, thankfully the slabs were forming on a different aspect. But being weary we made our way from the hostel, we crossed Bow river taking the opportunity to assess the line, with no significant concerns we made our way into the trees.

Cross Bow River and trend a bit to your right making your way up through the trees and eventually you’ll find yourself above treeline below Grand Daddy Couloir. We cautiously made our way up  the  fan,  and we did a quick transition to boot packing at the bottom of the line. From there it was a slow boot pack wading through chest high snow, soft snow was terrible for the way up but it was an amazing run down.

The beauty of Grand Daddy is that you  can go as high as you want. Bryan and I were a bit worried about some of the spin drifts coming off the sides and as we got near the  top we saw a few larger chunks of snow coming down on us. We went most of the way up except for the top little bit which gets a bit steeper. After a quick transition we were ready to make our way  down.

It was an absolutely exhilarating feeling standing on top of this line, a mix of nervousness and excitement. A bit of uncertainty, not quite knowing how my board was going to catch an edge when things were this steep. It was my first serious line, with a real “no fall zone” label. Once I got my first turn in and got moving my nervousness went all away, I got into a really nice flow. Indescribable feeling so good, THIS is what splitboarding IS.  From there Bryan and I did another lap on the fan, but if you don’t it’s a pleasant run through the trees back to Bow River. From there it’s a short walk back to the parking lot.
