I had heard about the super moon the morning of the 12th , I had nothing to do for the next few days so I 
decided to try and photograph the moon. Ive never tried to take a picture of the night sky so like any 
reasonable person, I googled it and watched a few YouTube videos, aaaaaaaand a few minuets later I was 
an expert. Well close enough.

So the night of the 12th I was closely looking at the cloud forecast and I it was saying that around 3am 
it should clear up a little, so I stayed up and went out. Sitting out in the cold, I could see the white 
glow behind the clouds of the moon but, nothing; it never fully showed its face.

The next morning, waking up and seeing all of the beautiful picture of the super moon on Instagram and
 Facebook, I wanted to try and get a shot of the moon myself; Once again looking at the forecast the sky 
 wasnt going to be clear. So this time the plan was to wake up and go early. So on the morning of the 14th 
 I got up at 5am to go set up by Mcnally High School overlooking downtown facing East, I got there around 
 6am. Sitting along the edge of the river for over an hour and nothing showed up. I moved location as the 
 morning approached, to above Conners Hill. Next thing I know the sun is up and no luck.

Looking at the weather forcast that evening was supposed to have clear skies. I had my fingers crossed the
 whole day and as the sun went down everything looked great. So around 5:30 I headed down towards Emily
 Murphy Park by the river. As I sat there it was pitch dark but I couldnt see anything. I was worried that
 the cloud was covering the sky again. After a little while there was a faint glow behind some buildings
 and a few minuits later the moon rose above the city. It was pretty spectacular. You could see the small
 details of the moon with the naked eyes. It was pretty amazing and got quite a few shots that I liked.
 I wish I had a little more of a zoom lens but working with what I got I was quite happy. I hope to do
 more shooting of the night sky, specifically the Aurora.

So looking at lots of photos of the super moon out there, my assumptions are that most of them are edited as 
I dont know how but the moon is REALLY bright! So Im not sure how, maybe a double exposure? but getting the
 proper exposure the photograph the moon and the dark scenery of the foreground is really hard. So Im not 
 sure how they did it. Maybe Im just a noob, but IDK. Anyhow this is my attempt of the "ideal supermoon 
 photo"!
