Last year I made probably one of the best decisions of my university career, where I decided to join the University of Alberta Outdoors Club. I met so many new people who are also excited about the mountains and the great outdoors! Since taking a step away from cycling it was nice to have a group of friends who were also interested in my passion. Then when it came time near the end of the year to start considering being a part of the executive team for the Outdoors Club. I’m pretty shit at socializing with people and making new friends so I didn’t think I would actually apply. But, Jason convinced me it kinda sounded like fun. Next thing I know I’m planning out a trip for the UAOC!

Near the beginning of October I helped run a trip for Evelyn called Larch Madness, where we took a bunch of members out to Bow Valley area where we explored Larch Valley above Moraine Lake. Unfortunately, in typical Rockies fashion an early winter set in to cut Larch season really short. We were initially scrambling up Eiffel peak but with the snow flying and winds giving us the chills we decided to just romp up Sentinel Pass. It was really cool watching the members wide eyed looking around taking in the incredible massifs towering over us. Living so close to the mountains sometimes makes me forget how truly world class these mountains are.

Then a few weeks later I ran my own trip combining two of my passions, exploring the mountains and photography. It was amazing to bring together a group of people who not only were enthralled by the mountains but also shared the desire to capture the beauty of our surroundings. I was thrilled to have a wide range of photographers from experienced to not owning a camera. Adventure photography is such an underrated area of photography that lots of people who own expensive equipment are afraid to explore because of the risks. But whos to say that we keep such amazing landscapes to ourselves when our stories could be told through an amazing visual experience. I really wanted to spark an interest in the members for not only exploring the outdoors but also capturing the moment.

After the trip talking to some of the people who were on their trip and those who were sharing their stoke on social media was really gratifying experience. I’m really hoping to spread the joy of the outdoors through the outdoors club!
