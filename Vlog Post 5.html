So since breaking my ankle, Ive been flipping through my interests other than cycling, and one of them 
is photography. Ive always liked taking photos, since I was little I used to take my parents 2 megapixel
 point and shoot camera and play around with it when we go camping. Soon after, my mom got a Nikon D60
 DSLR. It was a completely different level of technology, with much I couldnt understand. I started
 playing with the manual settings, leaning about ISO, aperture, shutter speed, white balance.

Looking for another hobby other than cycling I wanted to get into photography a little more.
 To learn the basics of photography I wanted to go back to the basics, properly learning about
 all technical aspects of photography. The best way I thought was shooting film. With the film
 camera, at least with old ones, almost all of the adjustments are manual. Fortunately for me
 we had an old Nikon F3 sitting around. One of the best classic cameras out there, and because
 of its popularity there were lots of videos explaining how to operate the camera out there.
 Digging around I found some unused films sitting around and I started shooting.

Ive only filled one film so far but, dropping off the film to be developed, and waiting was exciting.
 Usually with digital photography, you usually never get a chance to have your photos printed. It was
 awesome seeing the printed photos myself.

I will definitely be using the film camera a lot, as long as they keep selling films.
