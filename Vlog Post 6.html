Cyclocross Season 2016

After a disastrous last few weeks of my summer season, I took some time to recover completely before I 
delved into cyclocross season. Coming back from Winnipeg`s Canada Summer Games Test Event I was wreaked,
 being crammed in a car for 12 hours right after a race is a horrible recovery idea. Back in Edmonton, I
 just took the next week really easy just cleaning the dust off my cross bike, making sure it’s in race
 condition. I had tried to plan it out where I would have a slower start to the season, and use all of 
 the races as a build up towards the end, hopefully for nationals. By the time I started riding my cross
 bike, I had less than a week until the first race in Okotokes. I was feeling pretty sloppy on my cross
 skills like, running, dismounting, and remounting.

The race in Okotokes was interesting, the course had a solid mix of cornering and power sections, but
 unlike last year it was a fast course. I wasnt too nervous about the race itself since I didnt have
 too high of expectations, hoping that I would be at least around top 10. On Saturday I felt great, I
 made sure to not go too hard from the start. I personally felt like I was able to hold a very steady
 pace through the whole race, and getting back my cross skills. On Sunday I could definitely feel that
 I was much more tired, but I was looking forward to it, the morning was a little damp, so I was
 expecting the course to be a little choppy from the morning races. Instead by the time I raced it was
 ridiculously warm again and the course was still superfast and dry. Nearing the end of the race I could
 feel myself hurting, but I suffered through and still managed to get a top 10 finish, looking forward
 to a few weeks of solid training.

The week after was filled with lots and lots of boring long rides out on the road trying to build a 
little more of a base. Next was the Pump house Cross in Calgary, I was really looking forward to this 
race. This race in Calgary was always my favourite. This course had always been perfect for me, with 
lots of corners, and not much power sections. But this year was different; they had to move the course 
to a different park due to construction problems or something. The course still had fun technical 
sections, unfortunately it also had lots of straights with heavy! I mean HEAVY grass. It suuuucked. 
At the end of race, it came down to me and my team mate for 7th place, coming into the last corner with 
the barriers just before them, he hopped, I got off and ran. He was clean and fast through the barriers, 
and he got me in the end. At least the complete sufferfest had ended. On Sunday, the race never happened
 due to rain. Yes… A cross race cancelled due to rain.

Provincial Championships were up next, I didnt really taper, or peak for provincials this year as it was
 my first year in the elite category. I really had no expectation for this race, I was hoping to try and
 get into the front group, and stay in there for as long as possible. It was looking good from the start.
 I got the holeshot, than got chopped hard on the second corner. By the time we got to the first straight,
 I could immidiately feel the lack of power in my legs, and that was pretty much the story for the rest of
 the race. In the end I managed to hold on to 6th place which I was quite happy about, especially after a
 hard training week.

The next races were back in Edmonton, at the Argyle Community Park. Considering this week was a rest week
 for me, I was looking toward a good result to see how my training working. On Saturday, I had an amazing 
 start flying off the line. I was able to keep with the top group for the first little of the race, and no
 mistakes, I was able to get a 4th place, with 3rd right in my sights. On Sunday, I surprising felt better 
 than I expected, in the first few laps I just, made it into the lead group but I got dropped soon after. 
 Floating in no mans land between the lead group and the HUGE chase group. Not soon after I got swallowed 
 by the chase group. Me, my teammate and another strong guy from Hardcore were able to shed the chase 
 group. In the end it came down to me and the guy from Hardcore, having a drag race to the finish line.
 Thankfully I was able to take this one, and I ended up in 5th place.
