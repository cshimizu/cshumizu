Breaking My Ankle!

<p class="blogtext">
Earlier this year, I remember telling people Never have I ever broken a bone. After all these years of 
playing hockey, cycling, running, and lots of other sports, it has caught up to me. 
</p>






<p class="blogtext">
It all started with a simple training ride with Juventus on Sep 27 2016. We were meeting at the Glenora 
stairs right by the High Level Bridge, after doing a few sets of stairs to warm up we headed over towards 
Emily Murphy Park to practice cross skills. As soon as we got there Tracy (Our Coach) was going to make a
 small course through the trees, and meanwhile he wanted the rest of the group practicing run ups. He 
 pointed towards the hill going up towards Saskatchewan Drive and asked me to demonstrate. So as I head 
 towards the hill I ride up a good way, the moment I dismount I feel my left ankle twist and heard 3 
 distinct cracks. I thought Id be fine so I stood up immediately but a few moments later the pain set 
 in and immediately sat down again. The first few minutes were agonising pain, it was absolutely awful.
 At first I didnt really want to go to the hospital, maybe in the back of my mind I was hoping that my 
 ankle wasnt broken.

I ended up going to the Misericordia Community Hospital emergency. It was a lot of waiting and being 
wheeled around to getting x-rays. After waiting for a while the bad news came in, apparently I had 
something called a Weber B fracture in my left ankle. At first the doctors were saying that I may need 
surgery depending on if I tore the tendons on the inside of the ankle. Fortunately for me everything else
 was intact, and I went home with a cast on my ankle.

I had a check-up appointment a week later; by coincidence it was right on my birthday! (Oct 06 2016) 
That’s also the day I got some bad news, after another x-ray, I was told that the piece that was broken 
off in my ankle had a chance of shifting, so although I had the option of having, or not having surgery, 
I decided to get the surgery, the last thing I needed was to have to get another surgery 2 months from now.

So I went back to the hospital for the surgery the day later I was waiting to see if they would be able to 
get me in that day. For the surgery since I was going to be under general anaesthesia I had to fast for at 
least 8hrs before the surgery. All day until 6pm I had nothing to eat, and in the end I didnt get in that 
day. That night was the longest night of my entire life. I dont know why but I was really nervous for the 
surgery, and I couldnt get to sleep all night long, and by around 3am they came and woke me up to put in
 an IV. The next day around noon it was finally time. They move me onto a hospital bed and just like the 
 movies lol, they rolled me down to the surgery room. The surgery table was a lot smaller than I thought. 
 Next thing I know theres something cold flowing through the IV and I was passed out. Didnt even get to 
 count down from 10.

Next thing Im getting wheeled back to my room with a super heavy cast on my leg. The next few days were me 
just laying in bed as I felt the incision throbbing. 2 weeks later I had another doctors appointment. The 
pain was a lot more manageable. I didnt expect to but I they ended up taking the cast off of my leg, along
 with the staples closing the wound. When they cut the cast off I was surprised at the number of staples 
 on my ankle. There was at least 25-30staples right by each other, I expected them to be spaced out a lot
 more. Fortunately it didnt hurt as much as Id expected. After, I got into an aircast and I was off and 
 away for another 4 weeks.

It was a really LONG and BORING 4 weeks. After making this site, taking some photos, and watching a LOT of 
Youtube finally 4 weeks had passed. I was happy to hear that my ankle had healed up fine, and that I could 
start walking again; at least try. 
</p>






<p class="blogtext">
Aaaaaand thats where Im at right now. I am hobbling around everywhere. I was surprised at how fast I can 
put weight on it considering how much muscle mass Id lost on my left leg. By about a week in I could hobble
 around the house without my crutches.

 <br>
 Stay safe out there!
