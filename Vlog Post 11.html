5 Month UPDATE of an Broken Ankle
</p>

Alright so its already been 6 months since I broke my ankle, so far I have been able to go and ride outside, I can walk around, run, climb stairs. So you might
say its back to normal. But the truth is I feel like Im far from it. The first issue is that since I have a plate in the side of my ankle it makes it a little 
bigger. Its not much of an issue with normal shoes, but with the stiff sides and tight fitting cycling shoes, its a horrible combination. Every time I would
stand up of my bike, the side to side movement would move the shoe enough for the sides of the shoe to dig into where the plate is, and walking in my cycling
shoes are pretty much impossible.

Another major issue is my back, although my back was giving me issues before I broke my ankle it wasnt even close to how bad it is right now, where I cant even 
put my shoes or socks on standing up, I always have to sit down. Now after going to months of physiotherapy AND chiropractors, it has finally started getting
better, but it is still going much slower than I had hoped for. Sometimes I can barley sit at the dinner table properly to eat.Talking with the doctors apperently
its a fucked up combination of my upper glute muscles being tight, and my hip being misaligned. So yea thats fun to deal with, on the road bike it pretty much 
constantly hurts, especially if im riding for over an hour, on the mtb, if Im getting bounced around the whole time, my back will be killing me 30min into the ride.

The next on the list of issues is that I still havent made up the muscle strength that I lost over the 2 months of sitting around. Especially the ones that dont 
get activated by riding a bike. Im not sure if it is due to the lack of muscles, but the outside of my left calf (right above where I broke my ankle) is constantly
 sore sometimes to the point where I cant sit still, or even sleep. Then there are the random sharp pains around the general area.

 In all honesty, a part of me wonders if getting the surgery was a good idea afterall, than I wouldnt have the issue with my ankle being too big, and with out having 
 a huge incision in my ankle it wouldnt have taken so long to fix it self. But at the same time, it gave me the 100% chance that the ankle would heal properly. Well cant
 be regretting shit now. Anyhow I hope to be looking back at this in another 6 months with no such issues.
