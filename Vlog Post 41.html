It’s finally back after a 2 year absence from the BC Enduro Series (BCES) Steedz Enduro MTB Team and Bicycle Café have come together to put on a Canmore stop in the BCES again! I was really happy to find out about the race happening since I couldn’t make it out to the Crowsnest pass race this year. Although Enduro MTB racing, or as a matter of fact any MTB racing hasn’t been a too high of a priority unfortunately this year I was really looking forward to doing at least 1 enduro race. I drove out Saturday after work and made my way to Canmore. Fortunately, some friends of mine let me stay at their place for the weekend (THANK YOU SOO MUCH!!). It was definitely better then sleeping in my car for a change.

The next morning up bright and early I stopped by at my favorite breakfast place in Canmore, The Bagel Co for a delicious meal and made my way over to the Canmore Nordic Centre. It was still fairly cold in the morning but as I waited in line the sun started warming everything up. With familiar faces here and there it was nice to be in a different crowd. People were a lot more laid back, relaxed, just here for a good time. Results were the least of their worries. Signing on there was a small group of kids from the Juventus Enduro program that Brad (Redbike) had started. I started the day off riding with the kids up to stage one.

It felt weird to be riding my enduro bike again. It is an 2015 NS Eccentric steel, size small. A bit too small for me, but it works. Combined with a 27.5 wheels rather then the 29 on my XC bike, and no saddle in the way it felt like a little dirt jumper. I did a quick lap around Soft Yogurt (a nice flowy jump trail just beside the parking lot). And everything just felt weird. As the race started it was a much more relaxing pace then what I was used to. No lung busting, leg burning, lactate inducing, crazy start like the XC races. As well all chatted to kill time, we found ourselves waiting in line for stage 1. I was surprised when after the first 5 pedal stroke of the stage I felt amazing, the bike felt awesome and totally used to it. No awkwardness of 27.5 wheels or a small frame. As I make my way down whipping around the tight corners, pedalling as much as I could I forget how physical enduro races actually are. Pretty much a 5-minute max effort with a lot more pedalling then you’d expect. Well and it is in Canmore, one of the flattest courses on the BCES. This just got me excited for the rest of the day. Stage 2, stage 3. Im surprised I wasn’t getting caught by the RMCC Canmore locals who were around me. I definitely wasn’t making up time on them, but at least I didn’t get caught.

The stages were amazing with lots of trails that I’d usually wouldn’t have the chance to ride for XC races. Like T2 a super steep run out that I’ve only really ridden for these enduro races. On the way to stage 4 we passed by the feed station which was a saviour, it was a ridiculously hot day out and I’d run out of water by the start of stage 2. Stage 4 was a terrible one for me, although fun Im terrible at flowy jump trails; stage 4 was exactly that. At least there was a small uphill section at the end to make up time. Stage 5 and 6 was clean and fun as well, except for the hike a bike up to stage 6. I manage to make my way down and hand in the little timing chip, it spits out a little receipt telling me of all my stage times. I was the second person to check in so it told me I was 1st out of 2 riders. All well knowing that there were a lot of fast riders behind me. Also this race wasn’t going to be about results anyways, I’d give it my best but whatever result it may be all I cared about was that I had fun, which I did! After I indulge myself in the post-race burgers I quickly checked the results again and found out I was in fourth! I couldn’t believe it 10 seconds off the podium. I was super happy! I didn’t think I would do that well considering how little I’ve been riding this year.

All in all I had an amazing time with a well-organized event run by the Steedz Enduro MTB team and Bicycle Café, other then some a-hole sabotaging stage 2 sending a bunch of the Juventus Enduro team riders off course. Props to them for going all the way back up to re-do the stage. Thanks to all the volunteers and hopefully see you all next year!!
