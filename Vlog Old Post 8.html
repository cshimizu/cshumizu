Velocity Stage Race (First Ever Road Race and Cat 2!?)

This was my first ever road race(besides the one spring series road race) I was feeling super nervous 
about the weekend since I was racing Cat 2 for the qualifications for Western Canada Summer Games, I 
dident even have a road bike, instead I was on my cross bike from 2005! Having never done a time trial,
 road race, or a criterium, I did not know what to expect.
<br><br>
First was the time trial when they said it was around 7 km long I expected it to take around 15 minuets, 
but was surprised when the “roadies” were saying around 10 minuets, also worried since maybe it was just 
because I was much slower. Coming into this weekend I never set an expectation for my self, but instead 
just to experience everything, and so I did. I borrowed some clip on aero bars, and also used a time 
trial helmet. For this time trial we left at 30 sec intervals, although no one caught me I could definitely
 tell I was falling back, the guy in front of me was long gone, and the guy behind me was less then 5 
 seconds behind me when I finished. I ended up being 39th out of 44th which was okay, I couldn’t say 
 that I was happy, but I wasn’t last place at least I thought.
<br><br>
Next was the dreaded road race, 130 km of pain, going into it I was really nervous that I was going to get 
dropped with 3 laps to go and not be able to start in the criterium the next day. After the first lap I was
 feeling good, but by the 3rd lap I was starting to feel the pain in my legs, then the wind really picked 
 up and started to rain a bit, then the group accelerated which really took a lot out of me to keep up, 
 but after that I remembered a tip from the GCN youtube video where they said to move up in the pack so,
 when the group accelerates, even if you lose a few spots there are people to draft off of, and I did, 
 after every attack and the group slowed down I moved up, which worked until coming into the feed after
 the 5th lap, where the group accelerated, and I got dropped, and when I went to sprint to catch up with 
 the group my leg cramped up and I was done, it was a disappointing finish considering mostly no one got 
 dropped. I ended up 35th out of 37 finishers. My legs were completely dead after the road race, once I 
 got home I stretched out and quickly went to bed for the crit the next day.

My legs were feeling pretty tired the next day but hopeful since the crit suited my style, as I got to the
 familiar research centre I was feeling quite nervous after yesterdays result, after we warmed up I got on
 the course, the start was fine since I had spd pedals I quickly got clipped in and got the hole shot(If
 that matters to roadies) but not even a half a lap in some guy attacked, I could instantly feel my legs
 not wanting to corporate, only after 3 laps I got dropped, I was quite disappointed at myself, so I told
 myself when I get lapped 3 times im pulling the plug, so as I was making my way around the research centre
 I counted one, two, and three.
<br><br>
This weekend was a great learning experience for myself, but at the same time I was quite disappointed  at
 myself on how for the events I could not even finish with the main group, I have learnt lots from this
 weekend and hope to have a better road race, next time.
