My 2016 Season Part 1

Yay! Thanks for checking out my site, this will be an update on how my summer went for 2016.
<br><br>
So the first race of the season was in Lethbridge and after my knee injury, I was able to get
 in a strong a training block as possible. I was looking forward to this race, excited and 
 nervous to see how effective my winter training would be against the locals. Unfortunately, 
 my race ended sooner than I had hoped. After getting off the line first at the first corner, 
 I was wrestling for positions coming into the single track we both got caught and went down. 
 When I fell I landed on my arm weird and ended up hyper-extending my elbow. My 12 hours of driving 
 to and back from Lethbridge ended up with a busted elbow and a 30 sec race.
<br><br>
Fortunately for me, I didnt break any bones in my elbow, but I was off my bike for 1-2 weeks. 
Even when I got back on my bike I was stuck to riding on the road. Thankfully the next few races
 were road races that I had already planned to do because they were selection races.
<br><br>
The first was the Velocity Road Race, and from last years experience, I was dreading this race inside.
 Thankfully they had changed the selection races to cat 3 this year instead of cat 1, so I actually had
 a chance of finishing the race with the bunch. At the start of the race I was feeling a bit anxious, the
 pain from my elbow was still on the back of my mind but I tried to ignore it as much as possible. In the
 end, all I remember of that race is how I tried moving up too slow at the end and trying to move up in the
 last 800m but having old masters yelling CENTER LINE! CENTER LINE! in my face and missing out on the
 sprint after all. Dam roadies. I was a little disappointed since I felt like I had a lot more in me at the
 end of the race. At least I finished with the group. The next day was the crit, all I remember from last year
 was riding around by myself for 40 minutes, so I was hoping I would at least be able to finish the race this 
 year. The race was pretty painful, lungs searing, legs burning, but I was in there. In the end, I didnt really
 get a result but it was nice to know that I still had some kind of fitness.

Next week was the Alex Stieda Classic, and I was sort of looking forward to this race because they were
 saying that this road race was going to have a gravel section in the race, as a mountain biker that 
 was music to my ears. Or so I thought, the first time we hit the gravel set the tone for the rest of 
 the race. Everyone was nervous on the gravel everybody wanted to be at the front avoiding any crashes.
 Next thing you know the pace is out of control, with people, just hammering through the section I was
 struggling with the gravel taking away all the power Id put down onto the bike. By the time we got 
 through the gravel section on the first lap the peloton was shattered and by luck, I had managed to 
 stick with the lead group; barley. At this point for me, it was quite evident that I didnt have the 
 legs that day so the rest of my game plan was to hold on for as long as possible. By the third lap,
 I got dropped on a climb on the other side of the course. Completely bonked, I managed to suck a guys 
 wheel until I got to the gravel sector where I got dropped and I barely dragged myself to the finish 
 line. For the crit next day I knew my legs were burnt from the road race, it was going to be a challenge
 to hold on. By luck, the crit was a points race where I would have to counter sprints every few laps 
 just to try and stay in the group, in the end, I was able to stay in the group; kinda.

At this point in the season, I was feeling my fitness starting to taper off as my elbow was recovering 
and I could start riding my mountain bike again. I was looking forward to doing a proper mountain bike 
race, I couldnt do any of the Tuesday night races so I was missing the high-intensity mountain bike
 riding.
<br><br>
This next race had a big star on my racing calendar, as it was the last chance for me to qualify for
 the provincial team to go out to nationals and other projects. My elbow was feeling much better, and 
 the race was out in Canmore, nice and technical just how I like it. Unfortunately, the race organizers
 decided to take a bunch of the courses significant features out essentially dumbing down the course.
 After having a decent start I could feel myself paying for it 3/4 way through the race. I was sitting 
 in the top 5 and I could see people were slowly catching up to me, I was trying my best to hold them 
 off. With my luck, on the second last lap, I got a flat at the very top of the course. I was one long,
 fun downhill section away from the pits. Thankfully there was a teammate coming up on me that dropped 
 off a tube and CO2 for me, but the race was gone. I could feel the season slipping away through my 
 fingers.
