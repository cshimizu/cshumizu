Ever since I got into cycling Ive always dreaded winter, the short days, cold temperature, and snow covered trails. As much as cycling can be a year round sport it just isnt the same riding the trails in the snow. No railing corners, the lack of speed, ice covered trails, and my feet going numb after 30 minutes. Every year I can only dream about going to Tucson, Spain, California, or even Victoria to escape the cold grip of Edmonton weather.

Its been in the back of my mind since the start of the school year, I wanted to escape to Victoria during winter break, or reading week in february. I had to, otherwise Id go crazy with the stress of starting university, working, and trying to have some kind of fitness for next race season. Winter break came too soon, with my dream Cinelli build coming together, and the Van Dessel Aloominator frame, I was broke. The last thing I wanted to do was spend the money Ive been saving up for the new Fox 32 Stepcast fork for my XC bike. So I looked ahead to reading week near the end of February, working out gas, housing, and food, Id hoped to have at least $700 saved up for the trip; a week in Victoria. I but with balancing school, work, and training I was missing shifts at work to try and get some last minuite studying in, there were times where I wouldnt even touch my bike for a week! It didnt look like this trip was going to come together Id be spending another long, cold, snowy week in Edmonton.

    <div><p class=blogpictext> Or I guess I could go and enjoy a few days in the mountains.</p></div>     
    
<p class="blogtext">
But what do I really love to do? Look at new shiny components on my bike? Or be actually RIDING the bike? The choice was obvious, spending a week riding in Victoria would be much more enjoyable than looking at a new fork on my bike for another 3 months before Id be riding dirt. I could always buy a new fork, but Id never make up lost time of riding in Victoria. So I immediately booked my hostels, and told my parents peace out.

Although Ive been on all of the highway from Edmonton to Vancouver, Ive never been in the drivers seat. The drive was much more fun sitting in the drivers seat; got the jams going and driving through the rockys was absolutely beautiful! The sun was out, the roads were pretty nice, although a bit icy on some sections. Passing by Valemount and Kamloops reminded me of all of the road trips Ive done with Juventus (my cycling club) and my family. 11 hours later it was dark out surrounded by traffic, not really knowing where I was headed I pulled off the highway into downtown Vancouver and stopped at the first gas station that I found. And to my surprise while filling up my car, I took a closer look at the price and it was fu*king 151cents/L it was even more expensive than Valemount or Kamloops! After getting over the shock of how expensive gas was in Vancouver I rolled into an Ikea parking lot in Richmond, parked in the far corner, pulled out my small air mattress, sleeping bag and passed out in the back of my car.

    <div><p class=blogpictext> First time riding the Vancouver - Victoria Ferry. Its friggin expensive! It was $75 for my car and myself.</p></div>     
    
<p class="blogtext">
The next day, after watching the Rocky Mountain Enduro Team video on Pinkbike I decided to go and check out North Van it looked too good I couldnt resist! By the time I got there it was absolutely pouring rain and the ground was covered in slush! Riding around in the rain, freezing cold I could barely ride for more than an hour. It was exciting to be riding at the roots of mountain biking but it kinda sucked since I couldnt even see where I was going with the trail covered under a few cm of snow! After sitting in my car shivering for a little while I went into town for some coffee; ofcourse. The next morning as I jump awake in my hostel only to realize I slept in, I tip toed my way around the room quietly but frankticly collecting my goods and ran out the door. As I kept checking the time my google maps would agree that I would make it to the ferry on time one minute, then after getting caught at a red light it would say Id show up a minute late. It was truly the most nerve wracking drive of my life, I made it on the boat with 2 minutes to spare.

 Oh finally! I did it! I made it to glorious, glorious Victoria. Sun was gleaming roads were dry, trails were covered in dirt. It was exciting the first ride at Hartland, I hadnt ridden there since 2 years ago when I was there for the provincial team camp. I will spare you the details of every single rock and root that I rode over, but the next few days were absolute bliss. The trails were getting dryer, weather was amazing. There wasnt a moment that I didnt have a smile on my face. It was times like this that I really thought to myself, this is why I love what I love to do.

    <div><p class=blogpictext> Yes, that is snow.</p></div>

Citizens of Edmonton might not know but we are all cursed. A curse of bad weather, more specifically snow. Yes snow. In Victoria this thing called snow was something that fell, then melts away into the ground. The concept of snow accumulating is as unheard of as XC racers wearing baggy shorts. But it happened. My driving might have been fast enought to get away from the clouds 1200Km from home, but it caught up to me eventually dumping a ton of snow in Victoria. You can tell that this "snow" is an anomoly for Victorians because everyone started driving like they were drunk or something. The next day back out at the trails it reminded me of Edmonton, but worse. No one there owned fatbikes with $800 worth of studded tires to pack down the trails, infact I was the first and only one out on the trails the next day. When I was riding I would be staring at the trail infront of me soo hard like I thought my eye balls would pop out, I couldnt tell if the little hump of snow was a root, rock, or a huge pothole infront of me. I didnt know the trails well enough to send it for the boys (cringing right now) so I was riding slower than Victorians driving in the snow (Thats really, REALLY slow by the way). The last day in Victoria the snow didnt magically dissapear over night, so I decided to park my car at Hartland and go ride up the Observatory hill road that was only a few Km away, the view from the top was amazing and it actually made me wish Id had brought my road bike with me too, but I guess then I wouldnt be able to sleep in my car. YES I slept in my car a few times this trip, Im a broke student ok? Dont judge. The next day I crossed the water back to Vancouver (No I cant walk or drive on water, I took the ferry) and spent most of the day fulfilling the shopping list my mother, father, and sister wanted from Vancouver.

The drive home was actually great... and terrible at the same time. I had my music going full blast singing along the entire 13 hrs. But the roads were soo terrible, Id never ridden in such terrible white out conditions but I lived to tell the story, or at least I think so. Im pretty sure afterlife doesnt have Starbucks for me to sit at and write blogs (I know Im so hip).

Anyways so yeah, I spend an entire week and pretty much all of my money I had saved up to ride bikes and get snowed on. Yeah lets be honest what a stupid move, but I dont regret it... at least for now. Lifes too short to not do what you love. Even if its the dummest idea you've ever heard of, who cares?
