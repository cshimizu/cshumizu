My First Race of The Year

Well, the first big race of the year the Alex Steida Crit, I passed on the road race in fear that I would destroy my back again, which was a little disappointing because although getting dropped was inevitable I kinda enjoyed the gravel section of the race, it was something different. I took the week leading up to the race pretty easy trying to preserve my back as much as possible, just a few short rides beforehand.

The night before the race as I was getting my gear together I got an email from Aurora Watch saying that there was a 97% chance that Auroras would appear tonight, and with the clear skys I couldnt pass up on the opportunity. I ended up staying up until 4Am (Which wasnt the greatest way to prep for a race). The next morning I was up by 10 to finish getting my stuff and trying to get to the race nice and early, I really like going to races early and just taking in the vibes, and taking pictures is a nice bonus as well.

As the race neared I hopped onto my bike and started warming up my legs felt like jello, and my back was sore with in the first 5 minuits of spinning. Not what I was looking for. Another 10 minuits on the roller and I did what any good racer does, I said fuck it Ill just wing it! I hopped off the rollers and just sat around till the start. On the startline I could feel my heart racing as the start neared. The whistle goes off, I fumble with my pedals, I look up to my right, and ofcourse, I see Mike attacking off the line. My hopes of an easy start to the race goes out the window. I immediately go into survival mode looking for any draft I could hide behind. Once we caught onto Mike I had hoped that the pace would slowdown for a moment, my lungs were burning, legs sizzling in acid. Just regretting that I hadnt gotten in a proper warmup. But I was dreaming, it was just the beginning of a barrage of attacks from people 10x as strong as me. It was a painful 10 minuits. You might be surprised but during a crit my mind is running 110% thinking where I need to be in the next corner, which side of the pack I need to be on the next corner to be in the draft, if I should move up, where I lose time, where I make time. After about 15 minuits in the pack eased up a little a break had gone up the road, out of sight out of mind. I could start to feel my back tightning up. No matter how I positioned myself on the bike it was in pain. After another few laps the attacks began again, the teams, and individuals who missed the break were eager to do something, to make a move, at this point I was in survival mode, just hang on for dear life. As the attacks came the teammates of others up the road were right on the move, shutting everything and anything down, they were good. With each attack I found my self falling further and further down the pack, with little time and energy to move up between attacks. I was on the ropes. Everytime I look back there 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, riders behind me, then finally I blow up. I was ruthlessly spit out the back. Although I expected to be dropped, it was still disheartening, disappointing. With each vertebrae aching I packed up my stuff and headed home. My head filled with what ifs, rather than what next I reflect upon my disaster of a season so far even though its only the first race of the season, I can only imagine what the rest is going to be.
