Woah I see you made it the next level of procrastination. Before you get too far let me ask you, are you sure you don't have anything better to do? Homework? Housework? Actual WORK? Well, I warned you. So as you know my name is Cody Shimizu, I live in the city with the highest homicide rate in Canada (Its Edmonton BTW) in the province with TWO NHL hockey teams. I am currently going to school at the University of Alberta studying kinesiology. Uhh and thats about it, you know writing this make me realize how boring my life is, I typically spend my time studying or occasional taking photos. 
<br><br>
So how this blog came along is that I broke my ankle in the fall of 2016 and was really bored. Yea... thats about it... 
<br><br>
Oh... and I sometimes ride a bicycle, rock climb, hike, scramble, bikepack, splitboard, or just go on random adventures.
