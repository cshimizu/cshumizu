From the past two years of riding this course, I remember this course as a hard painful double track 
course, but that was when I was racing the short course. This year since I would be racing expert for 
the qualifiers for Western Canada Games, and the Provincial Team, I would be on the long course, after 
pre riding the course, I knew that it was going to hurt, this course had lots of climbing with some gnarly 
descents, and fast, flat double track sections. Coming off from a 4th from lethbridge I was looking 
forward to be able to be on the podium, but I knew there were a few strong guys out in the field.

From the start line I got the hole shot and made it into the single track first, it was nice to be able to 
choose my own lines and move on, I was surprised to see that I had managed a 5 second gap until I got to 
the flat double track where the rest of the field caught up, once we got to the double track/single track 
where there was a lot of up, down, I really pushed hard, as I knew I had to be first getting to the single
 track as there was no where to pass once we got it so I made a super hard effort up the last steep long 
 climb up to the single track, I thought I was going to puke, my heat rate felt like it was beyond infinity.
 Going into the single track I could still see a few strong guys strung out behind me. As I made it in 
 I cruised through the single track, and once I got to an opening I looked back and no one was to be seen,
 I was quoite surprised, but I took the opportunity and quickly put another effort. As I came to a slow 
 technical section I heard the group come right behind me, I still had a good 10 second gap so I put in 
 a hard effort through the single track, down the gnarly descent and through the double track, going 
 around the start loop that was set up I saw that I had a 30 second gap and pushed on, I was worried that 
 riding alone my pace would drop and let the guys behind me catch up, so I pushed hard through the double 
 track and pushed at a good pace coming through the second lap I didn’t know how much of a gap I had so 
 the whole last lap was me looking back to see where the guys behind me were, but they were no where to be 
 seen. Coming in towards the finish line I could not believe myself, I had managed to ride away from the 
 expert men field. I was ecstatic about this victory, setting me up nicely for the provincial team. I am 
 definitely looking forward to riding in Canmore next weekend!
