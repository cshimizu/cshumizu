University, it’s a place to meet new people, make new friends. In my first year of university I honestly didn’t make a lot of friends. I wasn’t the most social person out there actually far from it. The excitement of going to university last year I immediately signed up for the University of Alberta Outdoors Club, but with the stress of getting used to university and being socially awkward (gosh I sound like a loser) I ended up not going on a single trip.

 <div><p class=blogpictext>Yeah, there was a big group up there with us. Surprised that everyone made it to the midway point.</p></div>

This year going into the school year I was really hoping to be more active on campus and finally go on some of the UAOC trips. I made sure that I would go on one of the kickoff trips so I could meet new people and hopefully be easier. Last weekend I couldn’t pass up the opportunity to race provincials and hike with some of my close cycling friends. I decided to go to the second trip in Kananaskis.     </p>

Midnight Peak <br><br>
On Sunday morning, the entire group decided that everyone wanted to do the Baldy pass hike so we all pulled up into the parking lot which was crazy busy since there was a cross-country ski team trail running the entire thing. It was weird hiking with a massive group of about 25 people. Once we reached the ridge dividing Midnight peak, and Baldy mountain we split off into two groups. One for the summit bit and the other was going to turn around. Of course, I couldn’t pass up the opportunity to grab another summit. It was a fairly small group so we made good time. After hiking up from the split we were in a fairly exposed area pretty quickly. Up to that point the trail had been really mellow, then it was a bit more exposed from there even then a fairly easy scramble.

Up to that point the clouds had been thick and low. We couldn’t see anything, just a white haze surrounding us. Then as we reached above the treeline we were slowly rising above the fog it was absolutely incredible! Mystical actually. As we rose higher and higher we could just see the top of the mountains poking out of the fog. It was absolutely incredible. Midnight peak was one of the most incredible summits of my life.

After spending a good amount of time on the summit taking a bunch of photos we made quick work of the descent. Then made our way to the Banff hot springs. 
<br><br>
I was really glad that I finally managed to go on one of these trips. I met a whole bunch of new people, everyone was really friendly! I definitely am looking forward to the next one!
